Django Image Annotator
======================

This little app allows you to annotate a directory of images with bounding boxes and labels.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the annotator directory to your django project.
2. Add 'annotator' to the INSTALLED_APPS tuple in settings.py
3. add a setting called IMAGE_PATH to your settings.py. 
   This is the path containing image files to annotate (relative to MEDIA_ROOT)
4. add the following line to your urls.py:
   url(r'^annotator/', include('annotator.urls')),
4. run these two commands: 
    - python manage.py syncdb 
    - python manage.py collectstatic

Usage
-----

If you're running the server locally, you can find the app's pages at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/annotator/. 
You'll first need to click the link to scan the directory of images to 
annotate. Then you can annotate each of the labels, one image at a time.
You can add new labels to annotate via the admin.

There's an example installation included in the "example_installation" folder.
This uses sqlite3 as the db and comes with 3 images. It should just work with
python manage.py runserver
